You can integrate Coinbase Wallet into both web applications and native mobile applications.

### Web applications [](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/wallet-sdk/docs/welcome\#web-applications "Direct link to Web applications")

There are three ways to integrate Coinbase Wallet into your web applications:

1. [Injected provider](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/wallet-sdk/docs/injected-provider): The top-level web3 provider injected by the Coinbase Wallet browser extension.
2. [Coinbase Wallet SDK](https://www.smartwallet.dev/sdk/getting-started): An open source SDK which allows you to connect your applications to millions of Coinbase Wallet users.
3. Third-party libraries: The **most recommended** way to integrate. Open source libraries which allow you to easily add multi-wallet support within your web application (i.e. [wagmi](https://www.smartwallet.dev/guides/create-app/using-wagmi))

### Mobile applications [](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/wallet-sdk/docs/welcome\#mobile-applications "Direct link to Mobile applications")
